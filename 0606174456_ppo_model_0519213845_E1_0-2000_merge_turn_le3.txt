assistant: Hi, how are you?
user: Great, do you have any good comedy suggestions?
assistant: Sure, there's Ghostbusters (1984) or Anchorman or Borat (2006) . Have you seen any of those?
user: Ghostbusters (1984) is a classic, i watched it decades ago. Would definitely enjoy anything similar to it. Borat (2006) i didn't like it, comedy there is vulgar. Haven't seen Anchorman, did you like it?
assistant: Yes Anchorman is definitely a classic. Borat (2006) has good social commentary, but I understand it's not for some. Stripes (1981) and Beetlejuice (1988) are both from the same era and have a similar feel as Ghostbusters (1984)
user: You are right Borat (2006) is not for everyone. I would watch Anchorman based on your suggestion. I absolutely loved Beetlejuice (1988) , story is phenomenal and great humor throughout the film.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
assistant: Beetlejuice (1988) is a cult classic. I'm glad you liked it. Since you enjoyed Beetlejuice (1988), I think you might also like The Addams Family (1991) and Edward Scissorhands (1990).

user: Deadpool (2016) sounds too sad

assistant: Ha ha. There's Sleepy Hollow High (2000)

assistant: Hello!
user: Hi how are you?!
assistant: Doing fine, and you?
user: Good thanks for asking what kind of movies do you like ?
assistant: I tend to like things that are visually distinctive with multiple layers to work with. I lean towards animation most of the time because of its expressiveness. A good example would be the bleakness of Waltz with Bashir (2008), an animated documentary that just throws away objectivity and tries to recreate a war moment through the eyes of its participants. What do you tend to like in films?
user: Hmm that’s pretty cool I will have to check that out and pay attention to it ! I like comedy and action especially Inception (2010)
assistant: Have you seen any of the Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy ( Shaun of the Dead (2004), Hot Fuzz (2007), The World's End (2013) )? They're delightful combinations of genre satire and genre tributes with tight cinematography and a delightful wit, directed by the person behind Baby Driver (2017) . They're quite British, but are otherwise extremely distinct and, despite not being connected in terms of story, feel like a cohesive series. (they also have running gags throughout, some of which are things brought up very early in the films and come back as a punchline you'd almost forget)

assistant: Hello!
user: Hi how are you?!
assistant: Doing fine, and you?
user: Good thanks for asking what kind of movies do you like ?
assistant: I tend to like things that are visually distinctive with multiple layers to work with. I lean towards animation most of the time because of its expressiveness. A good example would be the bleakness of Waltz with Bashir (2008), an animated documentary that just throws away objectivity and tries to recreate a war moment through the eyes of its participants. What do you tend to like in films?
user: Hmm that’s pretty cool I will have to check that out and pay attention to it ! I like comedy and action especially Inception (2010)
assistant: Have you seen any of the Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy ( Shaun of the Dead (2004), Hot Fuzz (2007), The World's End (2013) )? They're delightful combinations of genre satire and genre tributes with tight cinematography and a delightful wit, directed by the person behind Baby Driver (2017) . They're quite British, but are otherwise extremely distinct and, despite not being connected in terms of story, feel like a cohesive series. (they also have running gags throughout, some of which are things brought up very early in the films and come back as a punchline you'd almost forget)
user: I haven’t but I will add them to my list for sure !
assistant: Any other films you like in particular?
user: I usually watch American films
assistant: In that case, I can just recommend the aforementioned Baby Driver (2017), a fun and tightly-choreographed action film packed with wit, a heist film where almost everything is in sync with the music.
user: Is it on Netflix ?!
assistant: I'm not sure, but I can check not at this point, unfortunately
user: Ahhh dang no worries I’m sure I will be able to find it somewhere even the video store !
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
assistant: I'm glad you're optimistic about finding it.Before I recommend more movies, can you tell me what kind of comedies you enjoy? Do you like slapstick humor, dark comedies, or something else?

assistant: With that in mind, here are 10 movie recommendations that you might enjoy:1. Inception (2010)2. Memento (2000)3. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004)4. The Matrix (1999)5.

user: Hi!
assistant: Hi. How are you? What kind of movies do you like?
user: Can you recommend a movie for me that has British actors or is set in Britain? An example of this would be Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994) . I'm doing okay, thanks. I hope you are, too. I also really enjoyed The Full Monty (1997) . It was a hoot.
assistant: Thank you . I am . I haven't seen The Full Monty (1997) or Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994) . But let me think a little , because I am not really good with British actors )
